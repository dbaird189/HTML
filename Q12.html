<p>Hydrogen is combustible.

When we burn hydrogen,
the hydrogen combines with oxygen in the air
to produce steam, which when condensed, becomes water.
The chemical formula is:</p>

<p align= "center"> 2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

<p>To do a chemical formula in a web page,
we do not need very complicated text formatting.
The main thing is the
<i>subscript</i>.
But we also need to look up
a special character for the right pointing arrow.
The HTML mnemonic for right pointing arrow is
<b>rarr</b>.
Then we put the ampersand
"&amp;"
before the mnemonic, and a semi-colon
";"
after the mnemonic to generate the special character.
That is,</p>

<p align="center"> &amp;rarr; generates the right arrow "&rarr;"</p>
